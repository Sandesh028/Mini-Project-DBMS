# Mini-Project-DBMS

## üêæ Project Title

**Pet Adoption Management System (PAMS)**

---

## üéØ Project Overview

A web-based application that helps users browse adoptable pets, submit adoption requests, and manage adoption records. The admin can add, update, and remove pets and view adoption applications. The data is stored in a relational database and can be exported for reporting.

---

## üí° Key Objectives

1. Implement CRUD operations using a relational DBMS.
2. Demonstrate normalization and relationships between entities (pets, users, adoptions, etc.).
3. Use SQL queries for data retrieval and manipulation.
4. Provide a web interface for interaction with the database.
5. Enable data export (e.g., CSV, Excel, or PDF).

## üß± System Architecture

**3-tier architecture:**

1. **Frontend (Presentation Layer)** ‚Äî web UI for users and admin
2. **Backend (Application Layer)** ‚Äî handles logic, routes, and DB operations
3. **Database Layer** ‚Äî stores all data related to pets, users, and adoption requests

    - pet_id (PK)
    - name
    - species (Dog, Cat, Rabbit, etc.)
    - breed
    - age
    - gender
    - status (Available / Adopted)
3. **Adoption_Requests**
    - request_id (PK)
    - user_id (FK ‚Üí Users)
    - pet_id (FK ‚Üí Pets)
    - request_date
    - status (Pending / Approved / Rejected)
4. **Admin** *(optional)*
    - admin_id (PK)
    - username
    - password

- Submit adoption request form
- View status of adoption request

### üê∂ Admin Side

- Add new pets to database
- Update pet details or mark adopted
- View all adoption requests and approve/reject them
- Export adoption data (CSV or Excel)
